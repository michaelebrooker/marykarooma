Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts. But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.   Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks.  And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to  whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. 

It beggared all description.  It is meat and drink to me to see a clown:  Something wicked this way comes.  My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit.  It is my only suit, Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise.  At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms; Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.  Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
