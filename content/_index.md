I am a **British-Ugandan Landscape Architect** with a **BA(Hons), Diploma, and MA** - all in **Landscape Architecture** and from the University of Greenwich's Architectural School in London. 

After qualifying, I worked in private landscape practice in London and Kent, including a master-plan for a major new senior school. Following this I moved back to Uganda and for three years I was responsible for a landscape department with more than 500 people. I set up a landscape design design studio, and led a team of planners, architects, landscape architects as well having management for a large team of landscape implementers and maintainers. And I was acting Deputy Director of Planning for the City. 

I have also worked for the Royal Borough of Greenwich, London, where I was worked as lead Landscape Architect in carrying out work on parks, and pitching for funding for community projects which were then put out to tender for procurement to be implemented. 

And I have also worked as a lecturer. I wrote and taught an MA Landscape Architecture Course for Uganda Martyrs University at Nkosi.
