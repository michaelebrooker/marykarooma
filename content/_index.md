Hello and welcome - I'm a community champion in Southeast London, having had careers first as an NHS nurse and then a midwife and, after a career change and gaining a law degree, I have been a legal advisor working in the community. 

My background as British woman with Tamil roots that go deep, and my language skills, enable me to help those who may not have the best grasp of English to navigate the UK national and local Government's access to many important citizen needs. 

My spiritual life informs all I do as a life-long Christian. 

#### How can I help you?
  - Advocacy 
  - Cookery skills - all styles, and especially Asian

If you would like my help, then please fill in my [contact form](contact) with your name, and including your email address.
