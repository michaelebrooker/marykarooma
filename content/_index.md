Hello and welcome - I'm a community champion in Southeast London, having had careers first as an NHS nurse and then a midwife and, after a career change and gaining a law degree, I have been a legal advisor working in the community. 

My background as British woman with Tamil roots that go deep, and my language skills, enable me to help those who may not have the best grasp of English to navigate the UK national and local Government's access to many important citizen needs. 

My spiritual life informs all I do as a life-long Christian. 

#### How can I help you?
  - Landlord issues
  - Passport applications and UK Driving licences
  - Council Tax benefit and discounts
  - Disability access to care, including: 
  -  Personal Independence Payments, also call PIP. You need to know how the system works to be successful at convincing the assessors that you need help with everyday with living. 
  - Spiritual (Christian) counselling, relationships, marriage, children 
  - Safe guarding issues
  - Other things ... 

If you would like my help, then please fill in my contact form with your name, email address or phone number.
