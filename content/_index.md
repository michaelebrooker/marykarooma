I am a **British-Ugandan Landscape Architect** with a **BA(Hons), Diploma, and MA** - all in **Landscape Architecture** from the ***University of Greenwich's*** Architectural School in ***London.*** 

Currently working in London for a local authority, I worked in private landscape practice in London and Kent after qualifying. Following this I moved to Uganda and for three years I was responsible for a landscape department at ***Kampala Capital City Authority.*** I set up a landscape design design studio, and led a team of planners, architects, landscape architects as well having management for a large team of landscape implementers and maintainers.

I also wrote and taught an MA Landscape Architecture Course for Uganda Martyrs University at Nkosi.
