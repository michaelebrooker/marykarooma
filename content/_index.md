I am a British-Ugandan Landscape Architect working for a London Local Authority since 2017. I studied and qualified with an BA(hons) and landscape Diploma, in 2008 at the University of Greenwich and subsequently went on to take an MA also at Greenwich University's School of Architecture, specialising in Landscape Planning and Assessment. 

Having worked in two Landscape practices for some years in Kent and then Southeast London, I left to work in Uganda my place of birth, and while there I wrote and taught an MA Landscape Architecture course for Nkosi University's School of Architecture. Kampala is the Capital of Uganda and I was recruited by City's, then newly created regional authority, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), to work on landscape projects to 'turn the City green. 

Over a period of three years In my role at KCCA, I was responsible for more than 500 people, including creating a design studio, and leading a team of planners, architects, landscape architects as well as a large team of landscape implementers and maintainers. 

We carried out many landscape improvement schemes, and focussed a lot of our time on strategic planning for the City authority.
